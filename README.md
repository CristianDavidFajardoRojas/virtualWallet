# virtualWallet

## Introduction
Welcome to LAVAZY! This project is a Virtual Wallet prototype, showcasing the design and layout of a modern web-based financial management application. With my Virtual Wallet, i aim to provide users with a visually appealing and intuitive interface for managing their finances.

 ## Demo Video

Watch my demo video to get a glimpse of the user interface and design of my Virtual Wallet prototype. While the prototype is not functional, the video will give you an overview of how the application will look and feel once fully developed.

To explore the design of our Virtual Wallet prototype, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can navigate through the different sections of the application to see the layout, styling, and interactions i've implemented using HTML and CSS.
